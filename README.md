## Structure
The project is divided in two folders:
- API : Includes the backend part, with the endpoints connected to Firebase database to get, edit and delete information.
- my-app : Contains the React project with all the front end code that displays the web view. CSS is used for styles.
## Visualization
The app is deployed using Heroku for the backend (/API) and Firebase on the frontend (/my-app).
